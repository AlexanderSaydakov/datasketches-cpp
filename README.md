This is a C++ version of the DataSketches core library. See [Apache DataSketches home](http://datasketches.apache.org/)

Apache DataSketches is an open source, high-performance library of stochastic streaming algorithms commonly called "sketches" in the data sciences. Sketches are small, stateful programs that process massive data as a stream and can provide approximate answers, with mathematical guarantees, to computationally difficult queries orders-of-magnitude faster than traditional, exact methods.

This code requires C++11. It was tested with GCC 4.8.5 (standard in RedHat at the time of this writing), GCC 8.2.0 and Apple LLVM version 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4)

This includes Python bindings. For the Python interface, see the README notes in [the python subdirectory](https://github.com/apache/incubator-datasketches-cpp/tree/master/python).
